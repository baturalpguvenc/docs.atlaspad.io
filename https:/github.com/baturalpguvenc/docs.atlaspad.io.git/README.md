<mark style="background-color:blue;">**What is AtlasPad?**</mark>

AtlasPad stands as a pioneering Launchpad and IDO platform tailored for the Web3 projects, geared towards introducing their innovative concepts to the public and igniting their token ecosystems.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">**How does AtlasPad Operate?**</mark>

Functioning as a launchpad, AtlasPad caters to both participants and projects. Projects aspiring to join AtlasPad undergo a rigorous qualitative evaluation overseen by the AtlasPad team. These evaluations encompass various assessment criteria, including product-market fit, concept viability, team competency, and more.

Projects that successfully meet these criteria are offered two pathways: direct listing or participation in the incubation/acceleration program. AtlasPad's IDO platform welcomes projects that clear the qualitative evaluations.

Direct listings allow projects to forego incubation/acceleration programs and exclusively list for an IDO within the AtlasPad community.

Opting for incubation/acceleration offers numerous advantages, including co-marketing and community collaboration. The incubation program typically spans 12-18 months and encompasses the preparation, launch, and post-launch support stages. During the preparation phase, the mentor group streamlines internal processes, optimizes product systems, and assists projects in refining their roadmaps. The launch phase involves promotions and social coordination. Post-launch, AtlasPad offers advisory support, helping projects address the complexities that come with live products on the market.

Acceleration is a condensed version of incubation, designed to be completed within 3-4 months. It's a fitting option for well-established teams requiring specific, limited support.

When projects are poised to list on the platform and launch their token ecosystems, AtlasPad extends support in campaign preparation and community integration. After finalizing specifications like token supply, market rate, and sale duration, the project is listed, and a countdown to the opening begins.

The IDO is unveiled through various communication channels and press releases, followed by a two-round opening process.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">**The Role of AtlasPad Token (ATLP)**</mark>

APT operates as the catalyst for encouraging community engagement in project bootstrapping. It functions as an added reward system to incentivize membership. By staking a specified amount of APT tokens, AtlasPad community members gain exclusive benefits, including alpha access to IDO participation, airdrops, and more, fostering active participation and support within the AtlasPad ecosystem.
